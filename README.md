# Emscripten Test C++ / OpenGL

Emscripten is a neat tool that compiles C++ and OpenGL into javascript or wasm for the web.

This is a simple Emscripen test engine with C++ / Opengl / CMake / Linux.

# Problems
The express.js server instance doesn't handle queries the right way. It doesn't look very nice.

# How to Run<br/>
pkg install<br/>
* cmake
* emscripten

npm install<br/>
* expressjs


# TODO

third_party/GLM needs to be a package.
